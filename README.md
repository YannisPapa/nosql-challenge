# nosql-challenge

This is my submission for Module 12 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

There is one subfodler Resources containing establishments.json and the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb and NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb files can be found above in this repo.

Running NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb will give you a notebook that is used to set up and clean a mongodb database. Running NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb will give you a notebook that runs some query's on the mongodb database.
